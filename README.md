# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS
The Banking industry is the most essential functional unit for a countryâ€™s economy. When we come across the use of credit card, it came into play in the banking sector in the year 1958 in California by BOA. Credit card is the timeliest mode of payment in terms of pre-set credit limit. When we see with augmentation of technology, cashless payments have touched the peak. As the banking sector has also entered the scenario of digitalization, credit card usage is also increasing. Due to this expansion in technology, credit card fraudulent crimes are proliferating. It is important to take up new measures and stringent actions to limit the crime rates. Fraudulent activities impacts the consumers, merchants and the bank organization as well. Thus it is important to identify the fraud activities by classifying suspicious data from the transactional data. To detect the credit card fraud, various data mining techniques could be used. Some of the data mining techniques discussed in this paper are Support vector machine and Decision tree. Comparison of Support vector Machine and Decision Tree using python and detailed experimental results are proposed in this paper. After analysis, the support vector machine model with kernel as RBF works on an average accuracy of 95%.
